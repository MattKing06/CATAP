added new machine areas:

VELA_LASER
CLARA_LASER

These are for items in the laser trasnpsort system specifc to 
the vela and clara lines


Hardware 
You **cannot** have a virtual_cathode camera from  VELA and CLARA 
one One or NONE


screen_names for cam also count as alias_names

camera machine areas are defeind by where their screen is, 
not their PV root 

added some debugging print statements 
when parsing master_lattice files in function:
ConfigReader::compareFileWithTemplate()

there can be subtle errors in formatting the config files 
    SCREEN_NAME : VIRTUAL_CATHODE, VC # which screen is the camera looking at 


some subtleties with spaces beign copied into names ?? 
need to remove all scapes from names?
and set that as a design choice
